Recursion
	Ø A function calling itself directly or indirectly is called recursive.
	Ø Direct recursion
		·   In direct recursion function calling itself within its code.
	Ø Indirect recursion
		·  In indirect recursion one function calling another function within its code and another function call another function within its code.
In a recursion, we need to specify a stopping condition. Otherwise our recursive function will not stop. These specific stopping conditions for a function are called base case conditions.
